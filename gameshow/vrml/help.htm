<H1>The Cybertown Game</H1>
<H2><I>Where am I in Cybertown?</I></H2>
The Cybertown Game lets you play against your friends. There are ten game boards, each showing a view of Cybertown. These are uncommon views of common places you visit, so you have to look sharp to guess where the pictures were taken.
<H2>How to Play</H2>
Divide the players into teams, and have them stand on either the red or the blue areas. Choose one person to be the "Master of Cermonies," who will run the <A HREF="#control">control board</A>. If there are more than one player on each team, they must pick a team captain who will give the final answer to the Master of Ceremonies - only the team captain's answer will be accepted.
<P>
The game board is divided into 16 sections. 
<P>
The first team captain chooses a section to reveal by row letter and column number. For example, if the player said "B2," the Master of Ceremonies would reveal the section of the picture at the intersection of row B, column 2. The player (and his team) get to guess where in Cybertown the picture was taken.
<P>
If they get it right, they score one point. If they get it wrong, the opposite team chooses a section of the board to reveal, and takes a guess at the location.
<P>
Play continues back and forth until a team gets the correct answer. The team that guesses correctly scores one point, and you move on to the next game. The team that guesses the most places correctly wins the game.
<A NAME="control"></A><H2>How to Run the Control Board</H2>
The Master of Ceremonies (MC), and <i>only </i>the MC, goes to the Control Booth (you can use the Viewpoint menu to get there). The answers to the game are revealed to the MC, so if a player is in the Control Booth, there's not much point in playing the game.

<LH>To run the game:
<LI>Choose a player to go first, and ask them to choose a row letter and column number.
<LI>Click the corresponding Game Board button to reveal that section of the puzzle. The player is trying to guess the location where the picture was taken. The answer is shown on the right side of the control panel.
<LI>If the player guesses incorrectly, click the Wrong Answer button to play a suitable consolation song.
<LI>Alternate between teams, allowing them to select a section to reveal and guess at the location where the picture was taken.
<LI>When a team guess correctly, click the Right Answer button. This will reveal the rest of the picture and play a happy congratulatory song.
<LI>Click either a red or a blue score button to set the correct score.
<LI><FONT COLOR=RED>IMPORTANT</FONT> - Next click the Reset Board button, which covers up the picture.
<LI>Click one of the ten black buttons in the lower right of the control panel to choose a new game.
<LI>Continue until you've played all ten puzzles.
</OL>
If you have only two players, you can take turns as MC, revealing parts of the puzzle for one another. When each round is finished, the current MC should click the Reset Board button, then the new MC clicks the button to choose the new game.
<P>
Yes, it's possible to cheat playing this game. This is an online version of a table top board game. People should be playing for fun, and it's no fun if you look at the answers. Just as they can peek at the answers in Trivial Pursuit, people can play this game then pretend it's their first time. So please, friends, as always, no wagering.
